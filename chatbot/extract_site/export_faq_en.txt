Such devices will resort to the &amp;apos;eduroam&amp;apos; network, which supports both 2.4 GHz (802.11b/g) and 5 GHz (802.11a/n) cards. The new version of UvA-SecureW2 configures these networks correctly, with &amp;apos;UvA&amp;apos; as the preferred network and &amp;apos;Eduroam&amp;apos; as the second network. If you are considering purchasing a new device, be sure to check if it can connect to the 5GHz network and if it supports 802.11a or 802.11ac.</p></div>"]}
